    <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>“Understanding Progressive Enhancement” by Aaron Gustafson was written in 2008. Back then, the mobile web was growing fast, but it was still considered an insignificant part of most website designs. Fully featured websites nowadays are expected to run javascript and stylesheets in two or three distinct “modes” depending on the viewing device. Much like there was a push by Steve Champeon, Nick Finck, and others to get developers to put accessibility and compatibility into their design process before the “last quarter of the development cycle,” the same push has come for mobile viewing considerations, and the progressive enhancement perspective on this may be interpreted as making peanut M&Ms alongside caramel M&Ms. The mobile devices may never see “just the caramel,” but it would be pulled into the DOM for certain devices.</p>
    <p>Mozilla’s developer website has an entry on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement" title="Progressive Enhancement on MDN web docs">progressive enhancement</a>, which usefully links two of the most integral tools in implementing it: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection" title="Feature Detection on MDN web docs">feature detection</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill" title="Polyfill on MDN web docs">polyfills</a>. Ironically, the entry on polyfill mostly describes ways that this obsolescence-friendly tool has had parts become obsolete. It also describes the first version of jQuery as an example of a polyfill.</p>

    <h3>Dragon Project Revision, and Reflection</h3>
    <p>I observed a family member of mine as they accessed my project site on Github. I noticed how they didn't immediately realize how the FAQ would work with its “summary / details” deal, so I adapted some code from W3 to make those into javascript accordion sections. Additionally, they remarked explicitly that on the homepage, the background image on the middle section provided too little contrast against the white text, so I added a “bright-breakdown” class to handle it. If I did the project over, this would be the main thing I’d address. The “2 backgrounds” part would have been done better with a simple element having two backgrounds, and never involving absolute positioning. I suppose as a glutton for punishment, I figured, “How bad could it be?” Now I know from experience.</p>
    <p>I developed an increased appreciation for the development environment I used for most of this course: Notepad++. It’s fast, packed with features, and I like working untethered from the internet, especially when I have to worry about slow or dropped connections. I used its find and replace to add the changes to the FAQ without going over each question individually.</p>
    <p>This course confirmed my prejudice about the respective difficulties of html, css, and javascript. None of it has been too excruciating, but some aspects require more practice and careful consideration.</p>
